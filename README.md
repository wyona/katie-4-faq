# Katie 4 FAQ

This repository contains various clients to make your FAQ (managed by Katie) available on your website or whatever channel you would like your FAQ to be available.

More information about how to manage your FAQ by Katie can be found at https://ukatie.com/katie4faq.html

The repository currently contains only a pure JavaScript client, but we intend to make more clients available as soon as possible, like for example a white label SPA as Docker image.
