# Pure JavaScript client to integrate "Ask our Experts ..." into your website using the Katie API

If you already have setup a domain / knowledge base at Katie (https://ukatie.com), then configure the variable 'domainId' inside src/index.html and open the file src/index.html in your browser. You should then be able to send a question to an expert, whereas Katie will assist the expert by suggesting an answer :-)

The integration into your own website is straightforward by copying the various code snippets of src/index.html
