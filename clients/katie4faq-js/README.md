# Pure JavaScript client to integrate your FAQ into your website using the Katie API

If you already have setup a domain/FAQ at Katie (https://ukatie.com), then configure the variables 'domainId' and 'faqLanguage' inside src/index.html and open the file src/index.html in your browser. You should then see your FAQ and be able to search your FAQ using natural language :-)

The integration into your own website is straightforward by copying the various code snippets of src/index.html

See for example https://lucene-faq.ukatie.com/
